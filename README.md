## Installation

You can directly download executable file from [Release](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/releases) page, or build from the source:

```
git clone https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live.git
cd gameboy.live
go build -o gbdotlive main.go
```

## Usage

```
Usage of gbdotlive:
  -c config
        Set the game option list config file path
  -d    Use Debugger in GUI mode
  -f FPS
        Set the FPS in GUI mode (default 60)
  -g    Play specific game in GUI mode (default true)
  -h    This help
  -m    Turn on sound in GUI mode (default true)
  -p port
        Set the port for the cloud-gaming server (default 1989)
  -r ROM
        Set ROM file path to be played in GUI mode
  -s    Start a cloud-gaming server
```

### GUI mode

Play specified ROM file in GUI mode:

```
gbdotlive -r "Tetris.gb" 
```

### Set up a cloud gaming server

You can use `Gameboy.Live` as a "cloud gaming" server, where players use telnet to play Gameboy games in terminal without additional software installation required. (Except telnet itself XD)

First of all, a `gamelist.json` config file is required to specify game options, this is a typical example:

```json
[{
	"Title": "Tetris",
	"Path": "test.gb"
}, {
	"Title": "Dr. Mario",
	"Path": "Dr. Mario (JU) (V1.1).gb"
}, {
	"Title": "Legend of Zelda - Link's Awakening",
	"Path": "Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (U) (V1.2) [!].gb"
}]

```

It is recommended to test every ROMs before put them in the config file.

Next, start `Gameboy.Live` server with config file from the previous step:

```
gbdotlive -s -c "gamelist.json"
```

You will see an output like this, which means your server has started successfuly:

```
2019/04/30 21:27:56 Listen port: 1989 
```

Now, you can play games anywhere you want. The simulation and rendering process is done entirely on the server.

```
telnet <ip of your server>:<port>
```

To be careful of, this "cloud gaming" is only playable in terminals support [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) standard and UTF-8 charset. You can use `WSL` instead of `CMD` on Windows.

## Features & TODOs

- [x] CPU instruction emulation
- [x] Timer and interrupt
- [x] Support for ROM-only„ÄÅMBC1„ÄÅMBC2„ÄÅMBC3 cartridge
- [x] Sound emulation
- [x] Graphics emulation
- [x] Cloud gaming
- [x] ROM debugger

There are still many places to be perfectedÔºö

- [ ] Support Gameboy Color emulation

- [ ] Sound simulation is incomplete, still got differences compared to the Gameboy real machine
- [ ] Sprite priority issue (see `Wario Land II` and `Metroid II: Return of Samus`)
- [ ] Failed to pass Blargg's instruction timing test
- [ ] Game saving & restore in cartridge level
- [ ] Game saving & restore in emulator level
